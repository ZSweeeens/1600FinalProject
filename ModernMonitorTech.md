# Modern Monitor Techonologies

## Computer Monitor vs Television
While computer monitors and televisions are very similar products, the they each have their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as use cases where one may be preferred over the other. 

Televisions have a much larger scale, with most televisions measuring at least 40 inches on the diagonal, with some as large as 88 inches and beyond. Additionally, TVs come with attached speakers, and generally have a wider viewing angle than monitors. For these reasons, televisions are generally preferred in situations where they will be watched by multiple people at a variety of angles.

Computer monitors on the other hand are typically between 20 and 32 inches in size, and normally don't come with speakers. These smaller panels have a narrower viewing angle, but have a faster response time than televisions, meaning they are much better at displaying fast moving content. Computer monitors are also capable of refresh rates *well* beyond that of televisions, with some monitors having refresh rates up to 360 Hz, while televisions at 144 Hz are rare, and extremely expensive.

## Computer Panel Technology

## LCD Panels
Liquid-crystal displays have become the standard for computer monitors, but different types of LCD panels have their own pros and cons. The types of LCD panels found in most computer monitors today are TN, IPS, and VA panels.

### TN Panels

In TN panels, or twisted nematic panels, feature liquid crystals that form a ***twisted, helix shape*** when no electrical field is applied.

TN panels are by far the cheapest to produce, and have __by far__ the fastest response times, but have lackluster viewing angles and generally poor color reproduction. TN panels are best used in gaming applications, where picture of quality can be sacrificed for refresh rate and response time.


### IPS Panels

In-Plane Switching panels were designed to overcome the weaknesses associated with TN panels. IPS panels feature crystals that are aligned horizontally, ***in-plane*** with the display.

Made to counter the weaknesses for TN panels, IPS panels are the gold standard for color accuracy, and are capable of a viewing angle up to 178 degrees. This comes at a cost, as IPS panels are far more expensive to produce than TN panels, and until fairly recently weren't capable of refresh rates above 60 Hz. These features make IPS panels less than ideal for gaming, but perfect for professionals who rely on color quality, such as photographers and video editors.

### VA Panels

While IPS panels were created to right the wrongs of TN panels, VA panels, or vertical alignment panels, were created to combine the best of both worlds. VA panels feature crystals which take a vertical orientation, perpendicular to the screen when no electric field is applied.

VA panels are generally a compromise between TN and IPS panels. VA panels aren't capable of the color reproduction of IPS panels, or of the response time of TN panels, but VA panels are capable of very high contrast ratios, meaning they are capable of very dark blacks and very bright whites. Their place as a compromise between IPS and TN panels means that VA panels are very strong monitors for general use.

## Form Factors
### Ultrawide Monitors

While most monitors and televisions take the standard aspect ratio of 16:9, there has been a surge in popularity of ultrawide monitors, with aspect ratios of 21:9, and more recently 32:9. Ultrawide monitors, sometimes called doublewide monitors, can be as large as 49 inches on the diagonal, almost always featuring some kind of curvature. Ultrawide monitors generally have niche use cases, normally for a productivity-based setup, allowing multiple full-sized windows to be viewed at the same time.

### Virtual Reality Monitors

Within the last 10 years, virtual reality headsets have entered the mainstream as a wearable option marketed almost entirely for gaming. Starting with the [Oculus Rift,](https://www.oculus.com/rift/) VR headsets have created a place for themselves in the market, as they offer immersion that other varieties of monitors simply cannot match. VR headsets feature motion sensors, which track the wearer's head motion, and display a virtual reality effect on two small monitors inside the headset.


## Connections
### HDMI

![hdmi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83596405/117410593-42187480-aed8-11eb-9910-0e8e1600da26.jpg)

HDMI has been the gold standard for video/audio interface, particularly for televisions, since its inception in the mid-2000's. With version 2.1 released in 2017, HDMI cables are capable of carrying data at a rate of 42.6 gigabits per second. Up until HDMI 2.1, however, HDMI was incapable of 60 Hz refresh rates at resolutions above 4K, as well as displaying HDR10 video at a range of resolutions and refresh rates. 

### DisplayPort

![displayport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83596405/117410609-480e5580-aed8-11eb-8518-75e4ac1d268c.jpg)

For use in computer monitors, DisplayPort has become the preferred connection for most high-end users. This is because DisplayPort is capable of transferring data at speeds up to 80 gigabits per second, allowing for higher refresh rates at greater resolutions than HDMI.

### Thunderbolt

![thunderbolt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83596405/117411718-822c2700-aed9-11eb-8b5a-f4fd452d3539.jpg)

Thunderbolt is a fairly new technology developed by Intel in collaboration with Apple. Keeping in line with Apple's brand of elegant, minimalist designs, Thunderbolt is a connection capable of carrying video, audio, data, and power all through the same cable. Thunderbolt is capable of data rates up to 40 gigabits per second, almost in line with that of HDMI. Because its a new technology, Thunderbolt ports are still uncommon to find in monitors, but the ability to combine video, audio, and power into a single capable means that Thunderbolt definitely has a chance to claim monitor market share.
